## Introduction

ChatGLM**2**-6B is the second-generation version of the open-source bilingual (Chinese-English) chat model [ChatGLM-6B](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B). It retains the smooth conversation flow and low deployment threshold of the first-generation model, while introducing the following new features:

1. **Stronger Performance**: Based on the development experience of the first-generation ChatGLM model, we have fully upgraded the base model of ChatGLM2-6B. ChatGLM2-6B uses the hybrid objective function of [GLM](https://github.com/THUDM/GLM), and has undergone pre-training with 1.4T bilingual tokens and human preference alignment training. The [evaluation results](README.md#evaluation-results) show that, compared to the first-generation model, ChatGLM2-6B has achieved substantial improvements in performance on datasets like MMLU (+23%), CEval (+33%), GSM8K (+571%), BBH (+60%), showing strong competitiveness among models of the same size.
2. **Longer Context**: Based on [FlashAttention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) technique, we have extended the context length of the base model from 2K in ChatGLM-6B to 32K, and trained with a context length of 8K during the dialogue alignment, allowing for more rounds of dialogue. However, the current version of ChatGLM2-6B has limited understanding of single-round ultra-long documents, which we will focus on optimizing in future iterations.
3. **More Efficient Inference**: Based on [Multi-Query Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150) technique, ChatGLM2-6B has more efficient inference speed and lower GPU memory usage: under the official  implementation, the inference speed has increased by 42% compared to the first generation; under INT4 quantization, the dialogue length supported by 6G GPU memory has increased from 1K to 8K.
4. **More Open License**: ChatGLM2-6B weights are **completely open** for academic research, and **free commercial use** is also allowed after completing the [questionnaire](https://open.bigmodel.cn/mla/form).

Welcome to use the larger ChatGLM model on [chatglm.cn](https://chatglm.cn)

The open-source ChatGLM2-6B is intended to promote the development of LLMs together with the open-source community. We earnestly request developers and everyone to abide by the [open-source license](MODEL_LICENSE). Do not use the open-source model, code, or any derivatives from the open-source project for any purposes that may harm nations or societies, or for any services that have not undergone safety assessments and legal approval. **At present, our project team has not developed any applications based on ChatGLM2-6B, including web, Android, Apple iOS, and Windows App applications.**

Although the model strives to ensure the compliance and accuracy of data at each stage of training, due to the smaller scale of the ChatGLM2-6B model, and its susceptibility to probabilistic randomness, the accuracy of output content cannot be guaranteed, and the model can easily be misled. **Our project does not assume any risks or responsibilities arising from data security, public opinion risks, or any instances of the model being misled, abused, disseminated, or improperly used due to the open-source model and code.**

## Projects
Open source projects that accelerate ChatGLM2:

* [fastllm](https://github.com/ztxz16/fastllm/): Universal platform acceleration inference solution, single GPU batch inference can reach 10,000+ tokens per second, and it can run in real-time on mobile devices with a minimum of 3GB of memory (about 4~5 tokens/s on Snapdragon 865).
* [chatglm.cpp](https://github.com/li-plus/chatglm.cpp): Real-time CPU inference on a MacBook accelerated by quantization, similar to llama.cpp.
* [ChatGLM2-TPU](https://github.com/sophgo/ChatGLM2-TPU): Using the TPU accelerated inference solution, it runs about 5 token/s in real time on the end-side chip BM1684X (16T@FP16, 16G DDR).

## Inference Efficiency
ChatGLM2-6B employs [Multi-Query Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150) to improve inference speed. Here is a comparison of the average speed for generating 2000 tokens.


| Model | Inference Speed (tokens/s) |
| ----  | -----  |
| ChatGLM-6B  | 31.49 |
| ChatGLM2-6B | 44.62 |

> Under our official implementation, batch size = 1, max length = 2048, bf16 precision, tested with an A100-SXM-80G and PyTorch 2.0 environment

Multi-Query Attention also reduces the GPU memory usage of the KV Cache during inference. Additionally, ChatGLM2-6B uses Causal Mask for dialogue training, which allows the reuse of the KV Cache from previous rounds in continuous dialogues, further optimizing GPU memory usage. Therefore, when performing INT4 quantization inference with a 6GB GPU, while the first-generation ChatGLM-6B can only generate a maximum of 1119 tokens before running out of memory, ChatGLM2-6B can generate at least 8192 tokens.

| **Quantization** | **Encoding 2048 Tokens** | **Decoding 8192 Tokens** |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| FP16 / BF16 | 13.1 GB             | 12.8 GB             | 
| INT8           | 8.2 GB              | 8.1 GB              |
| INT4           | 5.5 GB              | 5.1 GB              |

> ChatGLM2-6B takes advantage of `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` introduced in PyTorch 2.0 for efficient Attention computation. If the PyTorch version is lower, it will fallback to the naive Attention implementation, which may result in higher GPU memory usage than shown in the table above.

We also tested the impact of quantization on model performance. The results show that the impact of quantization on model performance is within an acceptable range.

| Quantization | Accuracy (MMLU) | Accuracy (C-Eval dev) |
| ----- | ----- |-----------------------|
| BF16 | 45.47 | 53.57                 |
| INT4 | 43.13 | 50.30                 |

The implementation of the model is still in development. If you want to fix the used model implementation to ensure compatibility, you can add the `revision="v1.0"` parameter in the `from_pretrained` call. `v1.0` is the latest version number. For a complete list of versions, see [Change Log](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm2-6b#change-log).

### Web Demo

![web-demo](resources/web-demo.gif)

Install Gradio `pip install gradio`Ôºåand run [web_demo.py](web_demo.py):

```shell
python web_demo.py
```

The program runs a web server and outputs the URL. Open the URL in the browser to use the web demo.

#### CLI Demo

![cli-demo](resources/cli-demo.png)

Run [cli_demo.py](cli_demo.py) in the repo:

```shell
python cli_demo.py
```

The command runs an interactive program in the shell. Type your instruction in the shell and hit enter to generate the response. Type `clear` to clear the dialogue history and `stop` to terminate the program.

## API Deployment
First install the additional dependency `pip install fastapi uvicorn`. The run [api.py](api.py) in the repo.
```shell
python api.py
```
By default the api runs at the`8000`port of the local machine. You can call the API via 
```shell
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"prompt": "‰Ω†Â•Ω", "history": []}'
```
The returned value is
```shell
{
  "response":"‰Ω†Â•ΩüëãÔºÅÊàëÊòØ‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÂä©Êâã ChatGLM-6BÔºåÂæàÈ´òÂÖ¥ËßÅÂà∞‰Ω†ÔºåÊ¨¢ËøéÈóÆÊàë‰ªª‰ΩïÈóÆÈ¢ò„ÄÇ",

  "status":200,
  "time":"2023-03-23 21:38:40"
}
```
## Deployment

### Quantization

By default, the model parameters are loaded with FP16 precision, which require about 13GB of GPU memory. It your GPU memory is limited, you can try to load the model parameters with quantization:

```python
# hange according to your hardware. Only support 4/8 bit quantization now.
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm2-6b", trust_remote_code=True).quantize(8).cuda()
```

Model quantization will bring some performance loss on datasets. But after testing, ChatGLM2-6B can still perform natural and smooth generation under 4-bit quantization.

### CPU Deployment

If your computer is not equipped with GPU, you can also conduct inference on CPU, but the inference speed is slow (and taking about 32GB of memory):
```python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm2-6b", trust_remote_code=True).float()
```

### Inference on Mac

For Macs (and MacBooks) with Apple Silicon, it is possible to use the MPS backend to run ChatGLM-6B on the GPU. First, you need to refer to Apple's [official instructions](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch) to install PyTorch-Nightly. (The correct version number should be 2.1.0.dev2023xxxx, not 2.0.0).

Currently you must [load the model locally](README_en.md#load-the-model-locally) on MacOS. Change the code to load the model from your local path, and use the mps backend:
```python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("your local path", trust_remote_code=True).to('mps')
```

Loading a FP16 ChatGLM-6B model requires about 13GB of memory. Machines with less memory (such as a MacBook Pro with 16GB of memory) will use the virtual memory on the hard disk when there is insufficient free memory, resulting in a serious slowdown in inference speed.
